\textbf{Lyric Poetry: Sappho and Catullus}
\begin{itemize}
\item Poetry was meant to be read out loud
\item It seemed weird if you were reading something but not speaking it
\item Such as Homer, whose work was meant to be heard not read
\item Solo(monody) a song sung by one person
\item Choral sung by 12-15 person choir
\item A variety of metres(not simple like dactylic hexameter)
\item The meter is chosen to reflex the tone of the poem
\item Personal poetry - love, hate, ambition, spirituality, grief, etc.
\item Two Greek Poets from the island of Lesbos: Alkaios and Sappho
\item Painting of the two poets by Sir Lawrence Alma Tadema, 1881
