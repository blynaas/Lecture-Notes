\textbf{Quick Select}
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose we choose a pivot element y in the array A, and we restructure A so that all elements less than y precede y in A, and all elements greater that y occurs after y in A.
\item Quick Sort: recursively sort the Two splits(worst case $\Theta(n^2)$ best case $n\log (n)$
\item So what we do instead is check is the pivot is the item we are looking for we are done with the search
\item However if its bigger or smaller we recursively run the algorithm on the bigger or smaller half of the split.
\item This allows for only one recursive call per cycle.
\item This gives an average case eof $\Theta(n)$
\item To get a worst case $\Theta(n)$
\item Split into 5's for the first 10r + 5 elements
\item find the median of each set of 5
\item then use the median of medians to find the pivot
 
\end{itemize}
